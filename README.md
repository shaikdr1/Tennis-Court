# Tennis-Court-Booking-Management-System
 A website that allows tennis club members to register in
the website. next, they can use their name and password to log in
and book a tennis court. It also displays the schedule of the tennis
court for a specified date. A message is displayed after your booking
is completed. The main objective is to facilitate the booking of a
tennis court for the club members.

Visual Studio to develop the website. the front end used HTML and
CSS. For the backend use php (installed XAMP for PHPMYADMIN). For
automated testing used IntelliJ IDEA

Users can register for the website. For registering they need to
provide their details and management ID and can create a password
for them. Next, they can login into the website for making a booking
they can also view the bookings of the tennis court for a particular
day.If they have forgotten their password they need to register again
and create a new password but have to give the same details as
earlier. The major constraint for this website is cost constraint. The
project should be done in 500$. Target audience are club membersOf
different age group. At a given time we can make only 4 bookings in
the tennis ground. When no court is available for a given time it
displays all courts are filled message
